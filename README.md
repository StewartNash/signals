# Signals
# Software Defined Radio

The purpose of this repository is to house both electronics, documentation and code for a software defined radio project. In addition, this repository will also contain a significant amount of communications.

There is a library with an incipient collection of the aglorithms in Python. They will, of course, need to be translated into whatever language is required to be implemented on the hardware. This library can eventually be combined or moved into the signal processor repository, which is a signal processing library.
